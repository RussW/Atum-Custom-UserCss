# Custom CSS for Joomla 4 & 5 Atum Administrator template
A custom **user.css** for **Joomla 4 & 5 Administrator template** with minor and subtle size changes reducing some of the glare and super-sized look and feel. Minor improvements to the native (Joomla 5) dark-mode readability.

## Where to put this file
This is a css override (_user.css_) for _some elements_ of the **Joomla 4 & Joomla 5 Atum Administrator template**;

File Location:
> Joomla 4 (below J4.1.0): **/administrator/templates/atum/css/**_user.css_

> Joomla 4 & 5 : **/media/templates/administrator/atum/css/**_user.css_

_**Important Note:**_ if you already have a "_user.css_" in this folder, then some css overrides may already be in place, simply add the changes at the end of the existing user.css file.

### What does it do?
We found that some elements of the new Atum template were "over-sized" for our liking, especially on smaller viewports like laptops and tablets so some text and heading font sizes, grid column widths and menu styles have been subtly modified for a more compact layout. The current darkmode impementation was also a little scrappy with poor visibility, so there are some minor updates to improve readability and layout.

#### Found a bug or have a suggestion?
If you find any glaring errors or poor element specificity, or simply feel we've missed something useful or a potential improvement, [open an issue](https://github.com/hotmango/Atum-Custom-UserCss/issues) and let us know.
